  This is a web application that I created through FullStackOpen. The project helped me learn how to design a CRUD application with the modern MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS tech stack (also known as MERN). In Phonebook, the user can search for a contact, add a contact, or remove a contact. If an already existing contact is added, the user will be prompted with an update option.
  <br />
  I gained a lot of experience with developing a full-stack web application through this project. The frontend uses React and CSS, with axios as the HTTP client. The backend uses Express, a Node framework, and MongoDB Atlas for database storage. This experience taught me important concepts, such as Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), promises, validation, and debugging with both a frontend and a backend. Lastly, the application was originally deployed via Heroku. However, since Heroku will no longer be free in November 2022, I redeployed it to Fly.io.
